Problem Description:
You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of the i-th item. You are also given an integer k representing the total number of vouchers available.

Each voucher can be applied to any item. When a voucher is applied to an item, it halves the item's current price (using floor division). You can apply multiple vouchers to the same item, and each voucher stacks, i.e.:

1 voucher: floor(price / 2)

2 vouchers: floor(floor(price / 2) / 2), and so on...

You must use exactly k vouchers. After using all the vouchers, calculate the minimum total cost you have to pay for all items.

ðŸ§  Your Task:
Return the minimum total cost after applying the k vouchers optimally.
You may also return the final price of each item or the number of vouchers applied per item if needed.
